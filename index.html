      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>If you don't wanna watch the clip we leave here a little introduction about what proffesional gamer means.</p>
      <p>A gamer (sometimes also called player or electronic athlete and eathlete) is a person who plays interactive
        games, especially video games, tabletop role-playing games, and skill-based card games, and who plays for
        usually
        long periodsof time. Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they compete in some games for money. In some
        countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term "gaming" can refer to legalized gambling, which can take both
        traditional and digital forms,through online gambling. There are many different gamer communities around the
        world. Since the advent of the Internet,many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube or Twitch
        virtual communities, as well as in-person social clubs. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a profession for
        some. In April 2020, researchers found that top gamers shared the same mental toughness as olympian athletes.
      </p>
      <p>Professional gamers generally play video games for prize money or salaries. Usually, such individuals deeply
        study the game in order to master it and usually to play in competitions.[40] A pro gamer may also be another
        type
        of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries
        of Asia,
        particularly South Korea and China, professional gamers and teams are sponsored by large companies and can earn
        more than
        US$100,000 a year.[41] In 2006 Major League Gaming contracted several Halo 2 players including Tom "Tsquared"
        Taylor and
        members of Team Final Boss with US$250,000 yearly deals.[42] Many professional gamers find that competitions are
        able to
        provide a substantial amount of money to support themselves. However, oftentimes, these popular gamers can
        locate
        even more lucrative options. One such option is found through online live streaming of their games. These gamers
        who take
        time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream, usually through sponsorships with large
        companies
        looking
        for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer. Live streaming
        often
        occurs through popular websites such as Twitch, Hitbox, Mixer and YouTube. Professional gamers with particularly
        large
        followings can often bring their fan bases to watch them play on live streams. An example of this is shown
        through
        retired professional League of Legends player, Wei Han-Dong also known as "CaoMei".[43] Han-Dong had decided to
        retire from Esports due to his ability to acquire substantially higher pay through live streaming. His yearly
        salary
        through the Battle Flag TV live streaming service increased his pay to roughly $800,000 yearly.[citation needed]
        Live
        streaming can be seen by many as a truly lucrative way for professional gamers to make money in a way that can
        also lessen
        the pressure in the competitive scene.</p>

      <h1>How long do pro gamers practice?</h1>
      <p>The grind of pro gaming</p>
      <p>League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) players such as Larsen routinely practice for more than 12 hours
        per
        day, usually with one day off per week.</p>

      <h1>It's important to do live streaming!</h1>
      <p>The practice of livestreaming video games became popular in the mid-2010s on sites such as Twitch.[1] By 2014,
        Twitch
        streams had more traffic than HBO's online service and eventually hastened the closure of Justin.tv, which
        Twitch
        had
        originally spun out of.[2] In 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented sub-site and app
        that
        is
        intended to compete with Twitch.[3] Other notable video-game oriented streaming websites include Microsoft's
        Mixer,
        which shut down in July, 2020, Smashcast.tv, which was formed after the merging of Azubu and Hitbox.tv, and the
        South
        Korea-based afreecaTV and many China based sites like Huya Live, DouYu and Bilibili.

        Streamers and viewers register for free accounts with a service which lets them interact with each other by name
        and
        subscribe to, or "follow", specific streamers. Home video game consoles, such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
        contain
        built-in streaming and optional camera integration. Home computers use software such as Open Broadcaster
        Software
        or
        XSplit to upload a livestream to Twitch's servers.[2]

        With advancements in the technology, new gaming laptops are coming ready with online streaming for games.
        Manufacturers
        are using new graphics cards and better quality connectivity for online gaming experience.[4]

        Building an audience, CNET advises, is more difficult than setting up the software. Among other advice, game
        streamers
        recommend selecting a popular game, which is more likely to interest viewers than a rare title without a
        following.
        Popular titles in the mid-2010s include League of Legends, Dota 2, first-person shooters such as Counter Strike:
        Global
        Offensive, and card games such as Hearthstone. Viewers are more interested in players who play and entertain
        well,
        offering jokes, pop culture, and current event commentary instead of repetitive gameplay. Streamers also
        recommend
        keeping a schedule so viewers know when to watch, self-promotion on social media, and giveaway contests to build
        a
        follower count.[2]

        In August, 2020, China based video sharing website and live streaming service Bilibil paid Riot Games $113
        million
        for
        three years exclusive broadcast of League of Legends World Championship, Mid-Season Invitational and League of
        Legends
        All Star in China, It is the biggest deal in video game live streaming market which also makes China's video
        game
        live
        streaming market bigger than Twitch, YouTube Gaming, and Facebook Gaming combined according to journalist Rod
        “Slasher”
        Breslau.[5][6]</p>
      <p>Professional streamers often combine gameplay with highly knowledgeable or dextrous play and entertaining
        commentary.
        They can generate sufficient revenue from viewer subscriptions and donations, as well as platform advertisements
        and
        sponsorships from eSports organizations.[7] An October 2017 report from SuperData Research estimated that more
        people
        subscribed to video game streams and Let's Play videos on YouTube and Twitch than for all of HBO, Netflix, ESPN,
        and
        Hulu, combined.[8]</p>
      <p>There are many reasons why someone would want to record themselves playing games for a live audience.
        Professional
        streamers often indicate that they enjoy their job because they are their own boss and the amount of work they
        put
        in
        directly effects growth on their platform. So when a streamer is competent they flourish and there is a strong
        sense of
        personal accomplishment.[9] Another benefit is that it brings attention to video games of the streamers choosing
        so that
        games with small communities gain visibility.[10] For example, in 2013 several members of the Super Smash Bros
        Melee
        community live streamed in order to raise money to to become the 8th game featured at the prestigious tournament
        Evolution Championship Series and overturn a decision by Nintendo to ban the game from the event.[11]</p>

      <h1>3 Strategies to level up your video gaming marketing</h1>
      <h3>1. Focus on hyping up live events such as streams, announcements and competitions</h3>
      <p>The popularity of livestreaming is well-documented, with Twitch scoring millions of average viewers per day.
        Gamers are
        constantly on the hunt for new content to check out, preferably in real-time.

        That’s why so much of social media for gamers is centered around creating a sense of hype. After all, building
        anticipation gets people talking (and ultimately tuning in).

        Let’s look at some examples. Check out how Bethesda hypes up their upcoming digital #QuakeCon, including a
        variety
        of
        panels and livestreaming events.</p>
      <h3>2. Partner with streamers and up-and-coming gamers</h3>
      <p>Much like influencer marketing is all the rage with brands today, it makes perfect sense for those in the
        gaming
        industry to partner with streamers and gaming personalities.

        Doing so not only introduces your company to a new audience but also puts a face to your marketing efforts.</p>
      <h3>3. When in doubt, lean into humor and memes</h3>
      <p>Humor goes hand in hand with social media and gamers.

        Chalk it up to appealing to a younger audience or a demographic that’s constantly online. Either way, the common
        thread
        between studios both big and small is a humorous brand voice that doesn’t take itself too seriously.</p>
